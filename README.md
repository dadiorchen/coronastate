Centralizing all global coronavirus (Covid19) mapping data.

The coronavirus pandemic is everywhere, but we are having to look everywhere for the data
 to fight it. The CoronaState Project is an attempt to put all the data in one place, so we can know where it is, how it got there, and where it's going.

This data will be invaluable for epidemiologists in fighting Covid-19 and future diseases and pandemics. We can see how people traveled, and know where cases are so we know where to go.

## What we're doing

**Datasets** (see page)
*Linking to all global data sources, going  as locally as possible.
*Saving that data in this repository.
*Manually entering data where it isn't in a database or spreadsheet.
*Processing the data into single global datasets.

**Visualization** (see page)
*Developing a web map for use on both desktop and mobile.
*Developing further visualizations for mapping, graphing, mapping and so on.
*Linking to the best data visualizations.

Here is our current spreadsheet of data sources for each country:

This project requires development and coordination that will go slowly and will not be completed if only by volunteers. We need dedicated people so we can do the work thoroughly. We need people to invest in us with one time or regular donations.

Milestones needed, as of April 9, 2020:
$5,000 will allow us to firmly establish the project and its tools.
$15,000 will enable us to gather a global breadth of data.
$50,000 will enable us to truly cover the breadth of data and visualize it.
We can go further. Every amount of money can be put to good use.
